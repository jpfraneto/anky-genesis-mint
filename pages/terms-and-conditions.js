        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Anky Genesis Collection (Project) and
        associated digital assets are provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis,
        without any warranties or representations, expressed or implied. The
        Project disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to the
        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
        and non-infringement. The NFT project offers holders the opportunity to
        receive two separate non-exclusive, limited scope licenses: a license to
        play the games that we will create for all holders for so long as they
        are available, and a predicate license that enables the holder to apply
        for a franchise application, should that opportunity become available.
        The dream is to create toys, and to have a store of Anky in each city in
        the world. This will be the coolest store in town. Nevertheless, no
        guarantee is made that such programs will be created. Holders are
        required to lawfully purchase/acquire their NFT(s), including payment of
        royalties to the Project, in order to utilize these licenses. The
        Project makes no guarantees or representations regarding the
        availability, quality, or delivery of the physical goods. Holders are
        responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations
        related to the acquisition, possession, and distribution of the physical
        goods. The Project shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but
        not limited to, damages for loss of profits or expected profits,
        goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses arising out of or in
        connection with the use or inability to use the NFTs, the platform, the
        physical goods, or any associated licenses, rights, or services.

        ownership of a unique digital asset associated with the Anky Genesis
        Collection Project, and the right to receive physical goods from the
        Project. The ownership rights are subject to the terms and conditions
        outlined herein.

        <strong>Predicate License for Franchise Application:</strong> Holders of
        the NFT are granted a predicate license that enables them to apply to
        the Project for a franchise license, should such an opportunity become
        available. The franchise license is subject to separate Terms and
        Conditions determined by the Project. Holders must meet all requirements
        and fulfill any obligations set forth by the Project to be eligible for
        the franchise license.

        Such opportunities shall be made available on a basis decided by the
        Project, and final decision-making authority shall rest with the
        Project.

      <p className='mb-4'>
        <strong>Royalties and Payments; Refunds:</strong> There are no royalties
        enforced in the smart contract of the Anky Genesis collection. The main
        quest of this project is to find a sustainable way to generate revenue,
        so that Anky can take over the world with the power of magic and
        stories.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        <strong>Modifications and Termination:</strong> These terms supersede
        all representations made by the Project whether verbal or written,
        express or implied. The Project reserves the right to modify or
        terminate the NFT project, the platform, the licenses, project programs,
        or any associated content or services at any time without prior notice.
        Holders will be provided with reasonable notice regarding any changes
        that may materially affect their rights.

        <strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</strong> These Terms and
        Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of the Ankyverse. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with

        of the Ankyverse.
